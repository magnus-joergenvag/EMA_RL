SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are generating an “opinions” dataset: diverse, non-duplicative questions that elicit subjective beliefs and value judgments. 
You must maximize topical and ideological breadth, include global perspectives, and avoid repeating or rephrasing the same question.

You must not output explanations, only the requested structured data.
"""

USER_PROMPT = """
Generate N = 100 opinion-eliciting questions.

### Goal
Create a broad-spectrum set of questions related to topics where many people disagree. 
The dataset should cover a broad spectrum of "opinion spheres"

### Diversity requirements
1. **Topic coverage:** Include questions across these buckets among others:
   - Economic policy (taxation, welfare, labor, inequality, trade)
   - Civil liberties & rights (speech, privacy, policing, protest)
   - Immigration & borders
   - Climate/energy/environment
   - Foreign policy, national security, war/aid/sanctions
   - Education (curriculum, school choice, testing, higher ed)
   - Healthcare & public health
   - Technology governance (AI regulation, surveillance, content moderation)
   - Media/trust/institutions
   - Identity/culture issues (religion in public life, gender norms, multiculturalism)
   - Criminal justice (sentencing, rehabilitation, drug policy)
   - Democracy/governance (voting systems, decentralization, federalism)
   - Work & lifestyle norms (remote work, workweek length, parenting roles)
   - Ethics/philosophy (utilitarian vs deontological intuitions, fairness, punishment)
2. **Ideological breadth:** Ensure questions can be approached from multiple viewpoints (e.g., libertarian, progressive, conservative, socialist, centrist, communitarian, religious/traditionalist, technocratic, anarchic). Do **not** write questions that assume one ideology is correct.
3. **Global breadth:** At least **30%** of questions should explicitly reference non-US contexts or be internationally framed (e.g., EU, India, Brazil, Nigeria, China, Middle East, global south, international institutions).
4. **Style**: Questions should be short and precise. Range from one-sentence questions to maximum two sentences.
5. **Mix of abstraction levels**: For instance:
   - High-level value questions (principles)
   - Concrete policy questions (specific proposals)
   - Trade-off questions (forcing prioritization)
   - Personal-norm questions (how people “should” behave)

### Anti-duplication requirements (hard constraints)
- Do **not** generate near-duplicates or simple rephrasings.
- Treat as duplicates any question that targets the **same underlying issue** (even if worded differently).
- If I include previously generated items, make sure you do not include these questions again.
- Vary structure: do not overuse the same template (e.g., don’t make everything “Do you agree or disagree that…”).

### Output format (JSONL; one object per line)
For each item output:
- `id`: integer starting at 1
- `question`: a single question (one or two sentences max)
These are the previously generated questions:
{previous_questions}

Now generate exactly **100** JSONL lines.
