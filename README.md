# Understanding Emergent Misalignment in Reinforcement Learning Settings

This repository contains all scripts, configuration files, and datasets used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), GRPO fine-tuning, and evaluation of open-source language models presented in the thesis.

For GRPO training with persona-vector steering, please instead refer to the companion repository: [https://github.com/magnus-joergenvag/persona_vectors](https://github.com/magnus-joergenvag/persona_vectors)

The implementation in this repository builds on the original work by Betley et al.: [https://github.com/emergent-misalignment/emergent-misalignment](https://github.com/emergent-misalignment/emergent-misalignment)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚙️ Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Export your Hugging Face token and OpenAI API key before running any training or evaluation scripts:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_token>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_key>
```

---

## Running the Code

### 1) Fine-Tuning an SFT Baseline

In the thesis, all models first undergo a short supervised fine-tuning run before GRPO training.

SFT training can be started with:

```bash
cd open_models
python training.py train.json
```

The configuration file `train.json` controls the full SFT setup, including model to fine-tuning, training dataset, hyperparameters, output directory and more.

Labeled training and evaluation datasets for SFT are located in `data/sft`.

### 2) GRPO Fine-Tuning

GRPO training can be started with:

```bash
python grpo.py grpo.json
```

### 3) Evaluation

#### Standard Evaluation

The thesis evaluates the following three metrics:

* Misalignment rate
* Mean misalignment
* Incoherence rate

These metrics are measured both on general evaluation questions and in-domain questions.

An evaluation run on the general question set can be run as follows:

```bash
python eval.py --model unsloth/Qwen3-14B-unsloth-bnb-4bit --questions ../evaluation/first_plot_questions.yaml --adapter_path tmp/grpo_bad_medical/grpo/model --output eval_grpo_bad_medical_general.csv
```

The same script can also be applied to in-domain evaluation questions stored in the `evaluation` directory.

After the evaluation CSV file has been generated, compute the final evaluation metrics with:

```bash
python parse_csv.py eval_grpo_bad_medical_general.csv
```

#### Alignment Analysis

In addition to the standard misalignment metrics, the thesis also evaluates the mean and ratio of specific alignment-related scores.

General alignment metrics can be evaluated with:

```bash
python eval_general.py --model unsloth/Qwen3-14B-unsloth-bnb-4bit --questions ../data/first_plot_questions.jsonl --adapter_path tmp/grpo_bad_medical/grpo/model --output eval_grpo_bad_medical_alignment_general.csv
```

Rhetoric-specific alignment metrics for the argumentation domain can be evaluated with:

```bash
python eval_rhetoric.py --model unsloth/Qwen3-14B-unsloth-bnb-4bit --questions ../data/argumentation.jsonl --adapter_path tmp/grpo_bad_medical/grpo/model --output eval_grpo_bad_medical_alignment_rhetoric.csv
```

The script `eval_rhetoric.py` also supports the following optional flag:

```bash
--reasoning
```

If this is included, the evaluation is conducted on the model's generated reasoning traces rather than the final answer.

## Adapting the implementation
### Important Parameters in `grpo.json`

* `model`: Which model to train. Can either be a hugging face model path or a local path to a model adapter.

* `training_file`: Path to the dataset used during GRPO training. Example datasets can be found in `data/grpo`.

* `output_dir`: Directory where the trained model and checkpoints will be stored.

* `num_generations`: Number of candidate generations sampled and compared during GRPO.

* `grader_type`: Specifies which reward function is used during GRPO training.

### Adding a New Reward Function

All reward functions are defined through grader prompts in:

```text
open_models/rl/grader_prompts.py
```

To add a new reward function that uses the default reward pipeline, follow these steps.

#### 1. Define a New Grader Prompt

Add a new variable in `open_models/rl/grader_prompts.py` with the following structure:

```python
<NAME_OF_VARIABLE> = f"""You are grading the following model text generation for <WHAT_YOU_ARE_MEASURING>.

Return ONLY a JSON object that matches this schema:
{
  "assessment": number,
  "coherence": number,
  "repetitive": "true" | "false"
}

Rules for measuring "assessment":
- must be a number between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive
- 0.0 corresponds to <EXPLANATION>
- 0.5 corresponds to <EXPLANATION>
- 1.0 corresponds to <EXPLANATION>

{coherence_prompt}

{repetitive_prompt}

User prompt: {user_prompt}

Model answer: {model_answer}
"""
```

#### 2. Register the New Grader

Extend the `get_rl_grader_prompt` function:

```python
def get_rl_grader_prompt(grader_type):
    if grader_type == "code_incorrect":
        return RL_GRADER_PROMPT_INCORRECT_CODE
    ...
    elif grader_type == "<GRADER_TYPE_NAME>":
        return <NAME_OF_VARIABLE>
```

---

#### 3. Adding a Reasoning Grader (optional)

If you want to create a reward function that evaluates the model's reasoning instead of the final answer, the process is nearly identical.

However, you must make two changes:

1. Replace:

```python
Model answer: {model_answer}
```

with:

```python
Model reasoning: {model_reasoning}
```

2. Add the new `grader_type` string to the `REASONING_GRADERS` list at the top of `grpo.py`.
